springBootHistory="In 2012, an issue was filed on the Spring GitHub repo title, "Improved support for 'containerless' web applicaiton architectures." The issue's athor, Mike Youngstrom, wrote that "Traditionally Spring web applications have been embedded in a servlet container. This was useful in the past when the majority of enterprise applications ran in and depended on the servlet container for deployment and configuration. However, a servlet container comes with learning curve that we cannot assume new developers will have already overcome."His solution? Make it easier."I think that Spring's web application architecture can be significantly simplified," Youngstrom went on, "if it were to provide tools and a reference architecture that leveraged the Spring component and configuration model from top to bottom. Embedding and unifying the configuration of those common web container services within a Spring Container bootstrapped from a simple main() method."If you scroll down a bit on this repo page, you come to Phil Webb's comments. Mr. Webb, it just so happens, was a member of the Spring team. On August 6, 2013, Phil wrote, "Rather than fix this as part of the core Spring Framework we have decided to start a new project called Spring Boot that addresses this and a number of other issues." Phil Webb went on to co-create Spring Boot.So, it seems we can safely say that Spring Boot came about as way to make architecting and developing web applications with Spring more approachable. According to Spring Boot's README on GitHub, it "makes it easy to create Spring-powered, production-grade applications and services with absolute minimum fuss. It takes an opionated view of the Spring platform so that new and existing users can quickly get to the bits they need."Spring Boot's easy to use nature has led to rapid and widespread adoption. According to JetBrains's 2019 Developer Ecosystem survey, 56% of those surveyed said they use the Spring Boot framework when developing web applications, an increase of 14% over their previous year's survey. Additionally, 61% of respondents told JetBrains that they use Spring Boot as an alternative to application servers."
